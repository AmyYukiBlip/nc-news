### Project Summary

NC News is a frontend project built with React designed to connect to my Northcoders News API (https://github.com/AmyYukiBlip/News-API-Project). Working through a variety of feature tickets, I built up the frontend with mobile first in mind. NC news gives users the ability to view a list of articles that can be filtered on topic, sorted by creation date, comment and vote count. Users can also vote, add comments and delete comments on articles. To test the login page, try "grumpy19"!
